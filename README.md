# Mask Architecture Anomaly Segmentation for Road Scenes [[Course Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19gQ2uhI8jPxWIdGewkaA2DqihUnQLVfB/view?usp=drive_link)]
This repository provides a starter-code setup for the Real-Time Anomaly Segmentation project of the Machine Learning Course. It consists of the code base for training/testing ERFNet on the Cityscapes dataset and perform anomaly segmentation. It also contains some code referring to EoMT.

## Packages
For instructions, please refer to the README in each folder:

* [eval](eval) contains tools for evaluating/visualizing the an ERFNet model's output and performing anomaly segmentation.
* [trained_models](trained_models) Contains the ERFNet trained models for the baseline eval. 
* [eomt](eomt) It is almost the original folder of the EoMT project. Inside it you will find code to train and pretrained checkpoints for EoMT.
